# %player% - returns the player name
# %player_display% - returns the custom display name of the player
# %weapon% - returns a tooltip of the item name, lore, and enchantments

# %biome% - returns the biome the player was in

# %x% - returns the x position the player died at.
# %y% - returns the y position the player died at.
# %z% - returns the z position the player died at.
#
#Text components:
#
# Using "::" in the messages will create text components.
# Format as followed: Base text::Hover text::Action
# Actions must start with either COMMAND:, or SUGGEST_COMMAND:
# You can add lines in the hover messages like so "line one\nLine Two....."
# Examples:
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::COMMAND:tppos %x% %y% %z%"
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%"
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::SUGGEST_COMMAND:msg %player% lol noob"
#
# Permissions Based Messages
#
# For victims that have a specific permission set, EX: deathmessages.premium, the death message
# will be sent that is formatted as followed:
# PERMISSION[YOUR.PERM.HERE]%player% dead lol
#
# For killers that have a specific permission set, EX: deathmessages.premium, the death message
# will be sent that is formatted as followed:
# PERMISSION_KILLER[YOUR.PERM.HERE]%killer% REKT %player%
#
# Players that are in a region (With WorldGuard hook enabled) and is defined below, will be sending a custom
# region messages.
# Formatted as followed: "REGION[REGION_NAME]%player% died in a region"
# Example:
#
# Mobs:
#   player:
#     Melee:
#       - "%player% was slain by %killer%"
#       - "PERMISSION[deathmessages.premium]&6Premium %player% &fdied to %killer%
#       - "REGION[spawn]Idiot %player% died in spawn lol"
#       If the player has permission and in a region
#       - "REGION[spawn]PERMISSION[deathmessages.premium]Idiot premium %player% died in spawn lol"
#
# To completely remove the message for a certain death. Configure as followed:
# Natrual-Death:
#   Bed: []
# or
# Mobs:
#   Creeper:
#     Solo:
#       Explosion: []

# Due for there being no cure for laziness, this option ignores everything in the Mobs section and makes all messages
# appear the same.
